1)  Hello Tauseef Ansari

First, let's implement some semantic HTML markup to resolve some of the accessibility issues:

Replace this div.main with main element.
Replace the p element which is the first child of div.desc with a h1 element.
Second, to use the provided font, you can use link tag in your index.html or @import statement in your styles.css. I'll demonstrate the latter: @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');, then add this to your styles: body {font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;}.

Finally, adjust some of the styles to make them more efficient:

Remove all styles in div.main and div.GlobalContainer.
Define them on body tag instead:
body {
   display: flex;
   align-items: center;
   justify-content: center;
   margin: 0;
   min-height: 100vh;
   background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
Great effort on submitting your first solution. Wish you the best in your journey in front-end web development 👌






2) 👾Hello Tauseef, Congratulations on completing this challenge!

You’ve done really good work here putting everything together, I’ve some suggestions you can consider applying to your code to improve the html markup/semantic:

You've done the design for the wrong image, when you download the starter files the folder comes with 3 files (preview card, desktop and mobile) you've created the solution based on the preview and you should consider only the mobile + desktop images.

Remove the background-color from the container and add it to the body to make sure this color background will display it full screen.

The html structure is fine and works, but you can reduce at least 20% of your code cleaning the unnecessary elements, you start cleaning it by removing some unnecessary <div>. For this solution you wrap everything inside a single block of content using <div> or <main> (better option for accessibility) and put inside the whole content <img> / <h1> and <p>.

<body>
<main>
